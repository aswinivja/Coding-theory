# Coding-theory
The project demonstrates core concepts of Mathematical Coding Theory applied to data compression, error detection, error correction, and cryptography. It is designed as a modular Python package where each coding theory concept is implemented in its own module, with a main.py to showcase an end-to-end data transmission simulation.
